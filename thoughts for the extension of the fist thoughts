Is very easy to see that the 1 and -1 can be any number that is divisible with the number n that we
are focus and we try to produce his n^ outcome.Maybe we can say that number 5 has 50 position and within each of them
we can add 0,1 or -0,1...
What if this poisitions become infinite small...
the function that will give the possibility of statistic 5 will then be a gaussian distribution with centre the zero...
Is very intresting to map every area of that function (as the intgral of this gaussian distribution) to the corresponding number and see what will happen...
And what about primes?
Are they follow some pattern that we can extract?
We can make some simple code to answer to that questions and talk about it again then...




I leave this thought for fun because we know that every number will map to the number 1 but we can explore without being mathematical prejudiced.
